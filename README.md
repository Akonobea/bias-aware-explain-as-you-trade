## 📘 Overview

This project develops a **Bias-Aware Explain-as-You-Trade AI Agent** that combines market data, sentiment analysis, and explainable machine learning to generate trading recommendations with transparency and accountability.

Developed as part of a **Master’s in IoT & Big Data Analytics**, the system showcases the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques in algorithmic trading while monitoring model bias and ensuring fair decision-making.
